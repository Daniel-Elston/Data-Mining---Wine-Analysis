<h1 align='center'> (Early) Data Mining - Wine Analysis </h1>

<hr>

Here is a project I conducted for my data mining module. Much of the coding was conducted in the early stages of my Python learning. Please note that the code is not clean or up to industry standard.

A dataset of 14 features is used. Each feature has a wine attribute such as total phenols or flavanoids. Multidimensional scaling is applied to the 14 dimension table resulting in 2 dimensions.
